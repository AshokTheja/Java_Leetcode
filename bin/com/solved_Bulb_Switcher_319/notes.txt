Comparison

Your Code	
Time Complexity:  O(n log⁡n)
Space Complexity:  O(n)	


ChatGPT Version
Time Complexity:  O(n log⁡n)
Space Complexity:  O(n)

Key Observations

Time Complexity: Both implementations have the same time complexity, O(nlog⁡n)O(nlogn), since both follow the same pattern of outer and inner loops with harmonic growth.
Space Complexity: Both use O(n)O(n) space, but:
        Your code uses a String[] array, which is less memory-efficient compared to the boolean[] in the ChatGPT version.
        A boolean[] is more lightweight and avoids string operations.


Self observation:  Time & Space is same, but the logic in inner loop differs, as its moves the next k value to the exact double indices, Hence saving much time.
and the code space is drastically decreased by using boolean instead of String to decide Off / On.


Missed Observation: any switch will be on if its touched odd number of times.
